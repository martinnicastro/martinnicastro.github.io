He is a PhD candidate in Musicology at the <b>University of Pavia</b> (Italy). His research project, ["Milan 1958-1962: Music Topography of a City"](https://musictopography.github.io), aims at the historical reconstruction of the Milanese live music scene in the years of the economic boom; it uses a combination of digital mapping, network analysis and field research.

His music was reviewed by various influential magazines, such as <b>Rolling Stone</b>, <b>Rumore</b>, <b>Sentireascoltare</b>, <b>Il Manifesto</b> or <b>Internazionale</b> and it was broadcast on <b>MTV Music</b>. His album “Fragile”, written as Clio & Maurice, was among the 50 best records of 2021 according to the renowned Italian webzine Rockit.

As a touring musician he played in more than 15 countries across Europe, in Morocco and Russia. He collaborates as a composer, arranger or session musician with [Clio M](https://www.instagram.com/cliommusic/) and [Ali + The Stolen Boy](https://www.instagram.com/alixdo0000000/).

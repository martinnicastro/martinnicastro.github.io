### Pashmak, "Atlantic Thoughts" (2019)

Composition, strings and synths arrangements, violin.

"A compendium of all the best of international rock (pop) experiments, excellently blended in this style roller coaster" <b>Deerwaves</b>

"A mixture of sounds and influences among the most distant - from avant-garde  to electronics, from progressive nuances to the Balkans - for a perfectly harmonic synthesis, a new sound that the Italian scene so badly needs" <b>Rolling Stone</b>

"Great record of an unknown genre, you travel with the mind and the body. The musical atmospheres of Pashmak have few boundaries" <b>Rockit</b> (Record of the week)

"Even the most conventional moments convince and capture the listener [...] the Milanese quartet demonstrates that it has embraced the most significant suggestions of international electronic pop" <b>Sentireascoltare</b>
